This is little bug that appears when using EGOHTTPRequest and EGOImageView together.

Explanation:
Download and run the application in the iPhone simulator. You will see a window with two
EGOImageView and two buttons conveniently labeled "buggy" and "not buggy".

Click the "not buggy" button. This will send the setImageURL: method to one of the EGOImageViews.
The result is that that EGOImageView correctly shows the image.

Click the "buggy" button. This will initiate an asynchronous HTTP request to http://www.google.com
using the EGOHTTPRequest class. We set the delegate of this class so we can be notified when the request
is finished. When this happens, the method requestDidFinish: will be called. In this method we call
the setImageURL: method in the other EGOImageView. The result is that this EGOImageView never shows
the image although it should.
